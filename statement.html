<h1> Artist Statement </h1>

<p> Art is the most important touchstone of my life. It connects me into the world around me, and at the same time it crafts me as an individual. And throughout my 2 years here, I’ve learned what it means to everyone, and how it cultivates their own craft. Being in this environment has been nothing short of inspirational, but also revealing of who I am as an artist. </p>

<p> In a way, art is almost everything I’m not. It requires control where I emit chaos. It demands confidence where I feel meek. It’s deeply personal and yet you show it to the world. Art by itself does not define who I am, but it completes me as a person. It accentuates, sharpens, and demands that I mold what traits I do have into becoming a stronger artist. I want to continue because I feel like I haven’t reached my full potential as an artist yet. And what intrigues me is that this is a universal artist feeling. We always strive to be better, and that’s what I admire about every other artist I come across. </P>

<p> For me, my art attempts to represent the experience of the world around me all while informing my own. Because art is a two way vessel of communication, both as a personal outlet to the world and the world’s way of informing me. Making art allows you learn during the picture making process both technique and about the world around you. And yet, it’s one of the most selfish processes to be a part of. So much of the art making process relies on the individual making the art. While I attempt to use all of the information gathered, I’m also filling in the gaps of what I don’t know about my subject with what I do know about myself.I need to be an artist because of the control it enables me with. I want to be able to capture people’s attention, get a reaction and make something that will resonate with another individual. </p>


<p> Those are the things that art does for me. </p>
