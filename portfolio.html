   <h3>"Final Destination.", Digital Composite, 2019</h3>
   <p>My group (Team Steven-Josh-Lydia) chose option 2 for our set. As a group, our concept was the "Fictional Storage." There's all these items that exist in fiction, and it's weird that they just exist only in their specific situations? We wanted to ask the question, "Where are these objects when they're not in use?" For my specific piece, I wanted to to ask that question for my favorite video game, Super Smash Bros. There's all these items that randomly spawn in game, seemingly out of nowhere. Competitive players turn the items off, so I gave the items a place to exist: a warehouse where the items aren't used are stored. The title, "Final Destination."
